Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?

As a Product Data Scientist at Instagram, evaluating the success of the Instagram TV (IGTV) product involves monitoring a range of critical metrics. Firstly, user engagement plays a pivotal role, measured by factors such as viewing time and video completion rates, indicating the level of engagement and interest in the content. 
User growth is another key indicator, reflecting the number of users adopting IGTV and new user acquisitions attributed to the feature. Additionally, assessing content-related metrics, such as content uploads and quality, highlights the platform's appeal to content creators and consumers alike. Monetization metrics, including ad revenue and creator earnings, demonstrate the platform's financial viability and attractiveness to advertisers and influencers.
Ensuring user retention, gauged through churn rates and return user percentages, ensures long-term engagement. Audience demographics, feedback, personalization effectiveness, and platform integration are also crucial aspects to evaluate. Finally, competition analysis and compliance adherence further shape the perspective of IGTV's success. Successful IGTV is indicated by positive trends across these metrics, reflecting a vibrant and engaging platform that appeals to both users and creators while generating revenue and adhering to industry standards.
